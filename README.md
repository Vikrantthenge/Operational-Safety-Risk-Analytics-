## 👤 About Me

I am a **Senior Analytics Manager** focused on turning complex operational and business problems into:

- Forecasting & scenario models  
- KPI frameworks and performance governance  
- Risk indicators and decision dashboards  
- Automated analytics pipelines  

My work is used in **staffing decisions, capacity planning, SLA risk mitigation, and leadership performance reviews** — not just reporting.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

**Raw Ops Data (CSV)**  
↓  
**Databricks ETL (PySpark)**  
↓  
**Delta Lake Tables (Governed)**  
↓  
**Risk Scoring & ML Models**  
↓  
**Decision-Ready Dashboards (Streamlit)**


---


This project mirrors **real enterprise analytics flow**, not a toy demo.

---

## 🔄 ETL & Data Engineering (Databricks)

- Built automated ETL pipelines using **PySpark + Delta Lake**
- Processed **50,000+ operational records** across multiple years
- Standardized incident types, delay flags, and risk indicators
- Registered governed tables using **Unity Catalog**

### 📊 Incident Distribution (EDA Snapshot)

This validates incident concentration and operational risk hotspots **before modeling**.

---

## 🧠 ML-Powered Risk Detection

- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Objective:** Early detection of high-risk operational incidents  
- **Class imbalance handled** using `class_weight='balanced'`  
- Features engineered from delays, incident types, locations, and resources  

### 📈 Model Evaluation – Classification Report

The model was evaluated using **precision, recall, and F1-score**, ensuring reliable risk detection for decision use.

![Classification Report](https://github.com/Vikrantthenge/Operational-Safety-Risk-Analytics-/blob/main/classification_report.png?raw=true)

**Key Outcome**
- ~90% overall accuracy  
- ~92% recall for incident risk detection

## 📊 Decision Dashboard (Streamlit)

[![Launch Dashboard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch_Dashboard-HuggingFace-success?logo=huggingface&logoColor=black)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vthenge/risk-analytics)

**What leaders see**
- Incident trends by location and category  
- Risk score distributions  
- Performance gaps and bottlenecks  
- Downloadable risk summaries for review  

This dashboard is designed for **weekly/monthly leadership reviews**, not exploration.
