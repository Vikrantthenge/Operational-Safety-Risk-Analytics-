## 👤 About This Project (Recruiter Context)

This project demonstrates how **operational data is converted into decision-ready analytics** used for:

- Risk detection and early warning  
- KPI governance and performance reviews  
- Leadership planning and operational control  

It mirrors **real-world analytics ownership** — not dashboards for demos, but systems designed to support **planning, risk mitigation, and executive decisions**.

---

## 🎯 What This System Solves

- Identifies **high-risk operational patterns** before escalation  
- Replaces reactive reporting with **forward-looking risk signals**  
- Enables **structured performance reviews** using standardized KPIs  
- Supports leadership with **decision-grade analytics**, not raw charts  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack (Enterprise-Oriented)

- **Python, SQL**
- **PySpark** for scalable ETL
- **Databricks** for unified analytics & ML workflows
- **Delta Lake** for reliable, versioned storage
- **Unity Catalog** for data governance
- **Streamlit** deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview



---

## 🛠️ ETL Pipeline — Databricks

**Source**
- `sample_ops_data.csv`  
- ~50,000 operational records across multiple years  

**Transformations**
- Incident type normalization  
- Delay flag logic  
- Data quality checks  
- Feature preparation for ML  

**Output**
- Managed **Delta Table**
- Registered via **Unity Catalog**
- Ready for analytics and ML consumption  

---

## 🧠 ML-Powered Risk Detection

- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Objective:** Identify high-risk operational events  
- **Features:** Delay minutes, incident type, location, asset metadata  
- **Accuracy:** ~90% overall  
- **Recall (Risk Events):** ~92%  

This is **not academic ML** — it’s applied modeling designed to **reduce operational surprises**.

### What Leaders See
- Incident distribution by category and location  
- Risk score trends over time  
- KPI-driven operational visibility  
- Downloadable risk summaries for reviews  

Built for **clarity, speed, and action**, not vanity visuals.

---

## 📊 Impact & Outcomes

- Enabled **early risk detection** improving intervention readiness  
- Standardized operational KPIs for consistent performance reviews  
- Reduced dependency on manual incident analysis  
- Created a reusable analytics framework for scale

## 👔 Who This Project Is For

This project is intentionally aligned to roles involving:

- **Senior Analytics Manager**
- **Decision Analytics / Planning**
- **Operations, Supply Chain, Risk**
- **Performance & KPI Ownership**

It is **not optimized for Kaggle-style ML competitions** — it is built for **business impact**.

## 🙌 Closing Note

> *“Good analytics reduce noise. Great analytics reduce risk.”*

This project reflects how I approach analytics in leadership contexts:
- Clear problem framing  
- Governed data pipelines  
- Decision-ready outputs  
- Measurable business value
